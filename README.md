It's 2D platforming action game. Simply I implemented combat systems, and it is focusing on competition with others.
Hopefully enjoy the game.

Use keys to control: 
A key is moving left, D key is moving right, W key is using Zet pack to fly, and P key is attack.
When the player attacks four times, the player shot a strong projectile to hit bigger.

If the player got each point, some enemies appear in the map.
200 points - Enemy in air appears, it shots a projectile to the player, but cannot be killed.
500 points - Boos appears. His ablilties are Melee attack and high HP.
